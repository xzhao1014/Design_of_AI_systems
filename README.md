# Design_of_AI_sysytems
This repository is to manage the codes for various AI system design, these include,
- Movie recommendation system by user-based collaborative filtering approach
- Air pollution prediction system based on KNN classifier approach
- Breast cancer diagnostic system based on rule-based, random forest and logistic regression approaches
- Machine translation system based on probabilistic approach
- Tic-tac-toe game playing system based on Monte Carlo Tree Search approach
- Task-based dialogue system based on TF-IDF and rule-based approach

Each folder under the repository will contain one of the above topics. In the folders, you will find detailed discription and codes. 
These are all based on my own hard work. Welcome to have a look and provide suggestions!
